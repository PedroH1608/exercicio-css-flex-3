# CSS Flexbox Exercise 3

## Overview
This is the third CSS Flexbox exercise from the DevQuest course by Dev em Dobro. The project uses HTML and CSS to create a responsive layout.

## Features
- Responsive design using Flexbox
- Flexible content arrangement
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile-friendly layout

## Reflection
Looking back at this project with more experience, I realize several areas for improvement:
1. **Semantic HTML**: Could have used more semantic tags like `<nav>` for navigation elements
2. **Code Organization**: The code could have been written in a cleaner, more structured way
3. **Responsiveness**: The layout could be made more responsive to different screen sizes
